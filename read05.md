# The third day as a software devolopment 
+ Today we go throgh deeply into **CSS** langauge and learn how to dell with it. Here i will mention some of idea we lean today : <br>
the first thing to do it is to creat a css file and we mostly called **style.css** and we add int our folder and open it in vscode .<br>
Now you are ready to start edite your page using css tags, remember to chose the selecter tag first and then edit what you like.<br> 
some of topic we take tody :<br> 
+*color**: here you can use ( RGB, HEX, HSL ) .
Another interested topic called **box module** , as we lear evry element is abox module, and each box include three things: <br>
+**The border**: the border of the marks.<br>
+**The margin**:it is outside the box.<br>
+**The padding**: and it space inside the box .<br>
## Now we will reviewing the topic inside the **Duckett: HTML & CSS** book.<br>
+ **INTRODUCING CSS**:<br>
X CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.<br>
+ **COLOR**: <br>
Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
X There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
X Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
X It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
X CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.<br>
