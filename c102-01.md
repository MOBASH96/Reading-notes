## day-(1)-102
A-Today we start to learn how to write the HTML script as ```markdown``` language, so i will briefly explain what is the **Markdown** langauge 
```Markdown```: it is languge ust to generate HTML file in a ***lightweaght*** form .<br>
 for example in  HTML you need to tag it evry paragraph with **p></p**,  but in markdown you dont need to do that and so on .

In software the size matter so you need to use lightweaght language such as **Markdown**, so it have two important properties :<br>
**1.** ```lightweaght```   .<br>
**2.** ```very fast to write in it.```<br>
Last thing remember to name the file with this two options either **READ.me** or ***Index.***
The scand thing we talk about is the ```growth mindest``` , here what i think about it like the assignment want : <br>
When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort,without stoping learning. always hungry to learn more.<br>
this is my three growth mind reminders : see the Success of others if they can reach you also can , if you need to be someone leave an impprint in this world you need to foux and give effort  more than other, and always remember no pain no gain .
