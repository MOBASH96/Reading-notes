# Reading note - day 03 
+ After we tack introduction to **JS** , today we learn more about it 
+ ++The functions**: it is a paice of code we write to use it a multiuple time, and it writen like this : <br> 
function name(parameter) { here is what the function code is }.
+ **prompt** : it is a dynamic world use to write inside the box pop up .<br> 
it more like " alert " but it allow you to write inside.<br>
+ **mathmatic opration** : in **js** language we can use the math- opration like ( sum "+", sub"-", multi"*", division"/").<br>
remember that the **var** variable it is a string type and to do some math opration you need to convert it by using **parseInt**.<br>
+ Reading from the book 
The first topic is intro into **js** and it contain three thing we should know :<br> 
1. What is a script and how do I create one? <br>
2.How do computers fit in with the world around them? <br> 
3.How do I write a script for a web page?<br>
And then you should know the stracture of your js and we can follow this methods : <br> 
**1: DEFINE THE GOAL.**  <br>
**2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT.** <br>
**3: CODE EACH STEP.** <br>
+ Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task.
+ Then the book starttalk about the basic such as : 
A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. <br>
